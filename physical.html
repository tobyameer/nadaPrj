                • Consistency:<br>
                Conditioners have very light and runny consistency and spread more easily on your strands. When you apply a conditioner to wet hair, it breaks down very easily and spreads without any hassle.
                Additionally, since they have a lightweight texture, they do not weigh down your hair and make them easily manageable.

                •How can you increase skin absorption?
                For the conditioner to show results, you must exercise a little patience. After applying your conditioner, you can wait for anywhere between two to four minutes before rinsing it out. This allows the ingredients in your conditioner to absorb into your hair and deliver maximum conditioning.
                Shampooing while necessary, robs your hair of its natural oils, leading to dryness, frizz, damage and tangled locks. This is why conditioner is an important part of haircare routines as it adds the nourishment back into your tresses. We hope this article helped to know how to get the most out of it by learning how to use conditioner.

                •How does the temperature affect the product?
                When products go from hot to cold over a short period of time, it can affect the consistency of the formulas. In winter when products are shipped in colder temperatures, they can cool down which may temporarily cause them to become more viscous or thicker in consistency.</p>
